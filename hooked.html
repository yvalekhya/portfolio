<h1>Hooked App Redesign</h1><br><br><br><br>


<section class="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The hooked app is a rewards and deals app located around college towns
        with the goals of helping students to find cheaper meals for select
        stores.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement </h2>
    <p>Located in Davis, I have been using this app for a couple years now, with
        not many updates made to the app at all. The User Interface (UI) of this
        app is very minimalist and easy to read, however, some interfaces, such
        as the map view, are hard to distinguish. For example, when I want to
        view "hooked deals" near me, it displays the icons but it does not allow
        you to click on the icons to view which companies are located there.
        Instead, they have a left-to-right swipe image bar on the bottom of the
        screen in hierarchy of distance from the user. Although this interface
        is organized efficiently, I found it inconvenient for users to be able
        to pick which companies they specifically would like to choose to go to.
        Apart from this, I have also noticed that the app does not allow for
        filters. Which is a bummer, since every great product design
        incorporates user choices. The filters are very limited to the product,
        only offering location and time as choices to find "hooked deals."
        Filters that I find important to incorporate include: choices of
        cuisine, specific company searches, and distance. Although the concept
        behind this app is great, many people that I have interviewed agreed
        that this app is very limited and for picky eaters especially, this app
        is not efficiently usable. In my redesign, I chose to create a hamburger
        menu on the top right, to be able to create a new page of filters, and
        be able to customize what filters are most wanted, and having the
        ability to change it.</p>
