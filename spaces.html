        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Several students have expressed frustration about the lack of
            preferable study spots on campus; however, a pragmatic solution to
            this specific pain point remains to be accomplished.<br> <br>
            </p>
        <br><br><br>

    <h2>What is "Spaces"? </h2>

    <p> Spaces is an interactive interface that
        assists students in finding the available study spots on campus, emerging
        from the common challenges faced by students, especially
        concerning the Shield’s library. 

        <p>On top of studying for the difficult exams during midterms and finals
        seasons, students have voiced their struggles to actually find spaces on
        campus to study. Our group sent out a survey to UC Davis students to
        further investigate the relationship between students’ study habits and
        being able to find study spaces on campus. Based on the responses
        gathered, 75% of the students expressed that it was quite difficult to
        find spots to study on campus, as it would take them 20-30 minutes to
        look for them. The unfortunate truth, however, is that even after
        searching, students don’t always find study spots. When students are
        unable to find study spots, it affects their overall productivity and
        motivation to study in addition to increasing their frustration and
        stress in an already stressful time. Students tend to (1) go home to
        study, which ends up in getting distracted and losing focus, (2)
        postpone studying, which ends up in cramming right before the exam, or
        (3) alter sleep schedules, which ends up in them pulling all-nighters.

    <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
    <p>How can we make  </p> 

    <h2> Conceptual Model </h2>
    <p>After setting the problem scope and problem statement, our group focused
        the attention to crafting a list of possible recommendations and
        solutions. For our concept to be pragmatic, we also debated the most
        acceptable forms of interfaces on which we would possibly execute it.
        The conceptual layout circles around a schematic seat map indicating
        occupied and vacant seats with distinct colors. One of the many ways it
        solves the problem is by assisting students, who earlier would go up and
        down the individual floors to find seating of their choice, can now see
        before-hand which parts of the study spaces are available. This
        optimizes the process from a brute-force approach. Based on the survey,
        students also mentioned they prefer some seats over others based on
        their needs such as better lighting, better wi-fi connectivity,
        proximity to wall sockets etc. We included filters for the seat map,
        indicating ideal seats based on their preferences. The execution is
        based on our desire to make the entire process efficient. We followed
        HCI principles such as visibility and accessibility in order to make
        students understand and utilize our product’s features and
        functionalities. To tackle accessibility, we included our concept as an
        extension of the UC Davis app and plan to have physical structures
        containing our concept at different parts of the library to make it more
        visible. </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2> Prototype / Implementation </h2>
    <p> After conceptualizing, we chose to make our concept a website view due
        to
        the constraints we have faced regarding the Library’s vast floor plan.
        It was difficult to condense the floor plan into a mobile view
        considering all the filters, seat views, and table views for each and
        every floor. We started off our process with creating a myUC Davis tile
        for our concept “Study Spaces.” From the data we collected through our
        interviews and surveys, it was apparent that the majority of the
        students study at the Library on campus so we chose to focus on the
        Shields Library for our concept. We included a floor plan overview of
        the five floors of the library as an introductory page. We chose to make
        it aesthetically pleasing to attract an element of visual design. After
        clicking on a specific floor, we created a floor view showing the
        different sections. We included filters and preference selections on the
        right hand side of the section view, and a color coded key showing the
        overview of how many seats there are available on the left hand side of
        the section view page. We included screens of all edge cases such as “no
        spaces available” for too many preferences selected.<br><br>
        We included the table view and seat view separately in case people
        wanted to view the floor plans of each, and so the design would look
        seamless and clean. We wanted to display the information in a clean,
        minimalistic design so the information would not look too cluttered or
        frustrating for the user. We chose to do a table view first due to the
        variety of table layouts for each section in the library. We chose to
        have gray represent “no available spaces” and green to represent
        “available spaces” for the table view. We included a pop-up screen for
        the seat view that users can click on, for each green table view. For
        the seat view, we chose to label the unavailable seats in red, and the
        available seats in green. Due to the time constraints, our prototype is
        limited in functionality since we were not able to consider all 5 floors
        of the library, including the different sections, and table and seat
        layouts.
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>


    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>Our group decided to conduct user testing to see whether UC Davis
        students understood the interactions with the Spaces web application as
        well as get their feedback on a color palette that made the sections in
        the floorplan distinguishable. A total of 10 UC Davis students took part
        in the user testing sessions. For the first part of user testing, our
        group presented UC Davis students with scenarios for them to walk
        through. As an example of a scenario we presented to users, they were
        asked to find a seat on the first floor of the library with specific
        filters selected. The goal was to see if users could easily go through
        the task, without confusion or difficulty. If our users could understand
        the potential scenarios students may go through when interacting with
        application and easily use our product, we were on the right track. The
        second part of user testing consisted of presenting a few color palette
        variations and asking users to select their preferred one. Our aim for
        this was to narrow down a color palette that made each of the sections
        of the floorplan distinguishable but also cohesive. <br><br>
        Following the user testing sessions, our group reviewed over and
        analyzed the results. For the first portion of testing, users were able
        to easily understand and complete the different scenarios. This was the
        validation our group needed to move forward with our app flow and refine
        our design. For the second portion of testing, after presenting various
        color palette options, the majority of the users preferred the 3rd
        option we presented. Their reasoning for this was that the color scheme
        was overall very cohesive and the sections were easily identifiable.
        They did, however, provide us with suggestions to fix the color for one
        section in particular, as it stood out a bit from the rest. With the
        recommendations posed by our users, we proceeded to refine the color
        palette and finalized our design.
    </p><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>The aim for the “Spaces” concept was to come up with a solution that was
        mostly visual and highly interactive for users. Our solution, hence, was
        based on having floor plans, table views, and seat maps. However, we did
        run into a few challenges when designing, particularly with representing
        the library with full accuracy. When our group visited the library to
        get an idea how the floors were represented, the table and seat views,
        we found it hard to completely mimic every floor in the library. For
        example, some floors have a corresponding ½ floor and the central part
        of every floor has a pillar, which would hamper our overall layout. Each
        of the floorplans for the 5 floors of the library are also different,
        which made it more difficult to represent all the floorplans of the
        library. Having that said, our design does take into account all the 5
        floors in the library and mimics the seat layout to a plausible
        scenario. We chose to focus on one floor specifically, the 1st floor of
        Shields Library, to incorporate all the functionality that we planned
        for, including filters and preferences, sections, and table and seat
        views.<br><br>
        This project really emphasized the iterative nature of design, from the
        initial stages of defining the problem statement and understanding our
        users’ needs to sketching and prototyping a solution that would address
        our core issue. In particular, the most challenging part of our project
        was not actually the logistical issues or lack of resources and time; it
        was defining the problem statement and scoping out our project. Being
        able to figure out what the actual problem was for our users and
        conceptualizing a solution that addressed this problem was our main
        challenge. However, after numerous iterations of drafting the problem
        statement and requirements for the solution, designing the solution was
        not so difficult, and we did not have to make lots of changes to our
        concept after user testing. The medium-fidelity prototype that we
        designed still has a lot of room for improvement, but we were able to
        create a solution that matched our vision and addressed the core
        problem.
    </p><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>In the future, we would like to include all the floors of the library and
        have more accurate seat mapping. Students, who earlier would go up and
        down the individual floors to find seating of their choice, would be
        able to see before-hand which parts of the study spaces are available,
        thus improving the process from a brute-force approach. Currently, our
        prototype does not work with all the filters, so we would need to add
        additional functionality. The filters will make the process of finding
        an efficient spot easier. Another aspect of this problem we noticed from
        the survey responses was the difficulty faced by students in group
        studies. Till now, our prototype just shows the availability of the
        seats on the first floor, however, Spaces is more than that. We plan to
        tackle this problem by also including a section of the library available
        for reservation in our future implementation. We want it to let the
        users reserve their desired spots so that they can be ensured that the
        vacant spot is not taken by anyone else. To determine vacancy and
        occupancy of seats, we would also use weight sensors for individual
        seats. Lastly, for this project, we would like to expand Spaces by
        including more study areas on campus like the Silo, Memorial Union, and
        Student Community Center.

    <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>

    <p>“If I have to settle for a "bad" spot to study, it greatly affects my ability to focus and be productive. It also makes me frustrated that I spend time trying to find a spot when I could've used that time to study.”
